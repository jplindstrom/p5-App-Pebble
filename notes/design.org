* Design
** Concepts
*** Parser
**** Parsers turn Data into Objects
**** Parsers normally operate on a text stream
***** matching a line into attributes of a new or existing Object
**** e.g.
***** match regex and custom list of attributes
***** split regex and custom list of attributes
***** regex for /etc/passwd and predefined list of attributes
***** regex for "ls -l"
***** regex for Apache access logs
***** regex for your application's log file
***** CSV
**** You can write your own parsers, for your app's log files, etc.
**** Plugins loaded from various places
*** Command
**** A command is a shell command (usually) + a parser for its output
***** e.g.
****** df
****** du
****** ps
*** Objects
**** Moose objects
**** Objects are classless -- kinda
***** An object "class" is defined by its set of attributes
***** So, prototype based OO
**** You can transform an object into another object (and class)
***** by removing attributes you no longer want
***** by adding attributes and values
***** by adding attributes from Sources
**** The attributes of the current Object are aliased to lexicals inside a stage
***** Instead of $_->price, just use $price for getting/setting values
**** Attributes can have types (TODO)
***** With coercion
***** e.g.
****** file[Path::Class::File]
****** url[URL]
****** time[DateTime]
****** duraion[DateTime::Duration]
***** The types may be used by Renderers to influence how things are presented
****** e.g.
******* Whether to quote the values in
******** INSERT INTO product (title, price) VALUES ("Light Saber", 19.95);
******** O->new( title => "Light Saber", "price[Num]" => 19.95 )
*** Source
**** Utility routines
***** e.g.
****** S->Web->get
****** S->XPath
****** S->File->read
****** S->Time
******* now
******* parse
**** This is just like normal Perl
***** Normally wrappers around existing modules
***** but Sources have support for putting values back
****** into new or existing attributes of your Objects
***** Optimized for the common case, and brevity
*** Renderer
**** Renderers turn Objects into Data
***** Usually transorming the Objects to lines in the stream
***** But could also write data sideways into files, a db, etc.
**** JSON
**** XML
**** table
***** pools stuff
**** CSV
**** large_table
**** org_table
**** TT
**** SQL->insert
**** SQL->update
**** Graph->Simple->Bar
**** DB->connect()->insert
****
